                only remotely resembling punk, and pigeonholed as a joke act due to the puerile slant of its singles and
                associating music videos.</p>

              <p>Recorded from January to October 2003 with producer Jerry Finn, the album has been described as darker
                and more mature than the band's earlier work. It also marked a musical departure from their previous
                efforts, infusing experimental elements, inspired by lifestyle changes (the band members all became
                fathers before the album was released) and side projects, into their usual pop-punk sound. Its songs are
                sonically expansive and downcast, leading critics to view it as a more elaborate, mature side of the
                band. The songwriting is more personal in nature and explores darker territory, touching upon the
                realities of adulthood and unexpected hardships. In addition, its recording process was long and often
                unconventional.
